AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Allo-Check-Tusk (1),"Using the tip of the trunk, or its fingers, to feel the tusks of another elephant. Typically observed between males during Sparring when they appear to examine the size, length sharpness of combatant's tusks.References:Poole & Granli 2021.(Full reference list)",https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-ethogram/ethogram-table/behavior?id=4&cvid=MTM4Ng==
AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Allo-Trunk-Sucking (0),"An elephant grasping the trunk of another elephant, placing it in his or her mouth and sucking on it. A rare and possibly idiosyncratic behavior filmed on one occasion by an adolescent female toward her younger male sibling.References:Poole & Granli 2021.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,As-Touched-Rumble (3),"A short (1-2 seconds in duration) rumble made by an infant or calf when approached and or touched in a caring way by an older member of its family. This rumble has a rising and falling 'aauurrrrr' quality and is typically soft and tonal, though may sometimes be louder and more noisy. We refer to rumbles given in this context as As-Touched-Rumbles. The calling infant or calf engages Head-Raising and Ear-Lifting as it calls, behavior that is comparable to that exhibited by older individuals in the context of a Little-Greeting-Rumble and the quality of the As-Touched-Rumble is also similar.Like Little-Greeting-Rumbles, the calls given by calves in the context of receiving an affiliative gesture are highly variable, ranging from rather soft, unmodulated tonal rumbles to louder, more modulated and sometimes rather noisy rumbles. We believe that the difference, in both call types, is an expression of the intensity of emotion experienced by the calling individual. We postulate that the As-Touched-Rumble is a precursor to the Little-Greeting-Rumble.References:Poole 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Back-Toward (6),"Turning to present posterior and walking backward toward another or other, often higher-ranking, elephant(s). Back-Toward may be observed when individuals (usually adult/adolescent and juvenile females) attempt to join or move to a more central or advantageous position in a gathered group such as during a Bonding-Ceremony, when Bunching, when joining a Resting group, or when an adolescent female approaches a mother with a newborn. Males may engage in Back-Toward during Social Play with a larger partner.Back-Toward may sometimes be a gesture of appeasement to avoid an aggressive response by a larger elephant, or, within families, as a signal of respect - such as when joining a Resting group, or, in the case of Bunching it may be a way to keep eyes, ears and tusks pointed toward the perceived threat. All age sex groups may Back-Toward the carcass or bones of a dead elephant.References:Moss 1988; Moss 1992: 130; Poole 1996: 159; Kahl & Armstrong 2000; Langbauer 2000; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Bonding-Rumble (0),"Bonding-Rumble is a general term to refer to Rumbles that occur during Bonding-Ceremonies that have not been determined to be, specifically, Greeting-Rumbles, Estrous-Rumbles, or Female-Chorus-Rumbles. In other words they include the powerful overlapping Rumbles that occur during a Mating-Pandemonium, the birth of a calf, or during the formation of a Coalition or during High-Fiving or an End-Zone-Dance.References:Poole 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Defecating (0),"Passing faeces. As a component of Maintenance, Defecating is observed in all age sex groups. In the other contexts in which it is observed Defecating may be observed in moments of high arousal particularly among adult and juvenile females during intense social interactions.References:Moss 1988; Poole et al 1988; Poole, 1996: 275; Poole & Granli 2003.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Ear-Folding (2),"Forcing the lower half of ear under and back so that a prominent horizontal ridge or fold appears across the ear. In an Aggressive or Attacking context it may be used by male and female adults, adolescents, juveniles and calves in combination with a variety of other threats such as Head-High, Look-At, Advance-Toward, Charge, etc. to emphasize that an elephant “means business.”Ear-Folding can be either a short or a persistent display, the later indicating a ""foul mood"" or ""testiness"". Ear-Folding that is used in association with Head-Raising, Ear-Lifting or Rapid-Ear-Flapping is part of an Affiliative or Coalition Building display exhibited by adult, adolescent and juvenile females.References:Poole 1982: 86, illustration 6.1; Poole, 1987a; Moss 1988; Poole 1989a; Poole 1996: 75, 77, 128, 133; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Ear-Lifting (6),"Spreading and Lifting the ears so that the ear tops are lifted above the top of the head. An elephant normally holds its ears in a relaxed position such that they rest approximately 10-30cm from the side of the body and lie such that the tops of the ears are basically in line with the top of the head. In this relaxed position the ears do not appear stiff or tense, lifted, spread, or pressed against the body. The posture can be most clearly seen when adult, adolescent and juvenile female elephants engage in Little-Greetings-Rumbles or Coo-Rumbles, as they touch infants.Calves and Infants, likewise, may be observed to Ear-Lift as they are touched and respond with an As-Touched-Rumbles. Adult, adolescent, and juvenile females also display Ear-Lifting during more intense social interactions (e.g. Matings, Births, Greetings, Greeting-Ceremonies, Coalition formation etc.). During these highly aroused contexts Ear-Lifting is combined with Rapid-Ear-Flapping.References:Poole et al 1988; Poole 1996: 93; Poole 1999a; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Ear-Secretion (3),"A sudden squirting or streaming of secretion from the ear during events that cause high arousal, such as the birth of a baby, or extreme unease, such as the sudden sounds of predators nearby. It is not clear at this stage how long such secretions last, their function or whether elephant make use of this secretion as a signal.References:Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Ears-Stiff (0),"An elephant holding his or her ears tensed, cocked or stiffened. An elephant normally holds its ears in a relaxed position such that they rest approximately 10-30cm from the side of the body with the tops of the ears level with the top of the head. In this relaxed position the ears do not appear stiff or tense, lifted, spread, or pressed against the body. Different age sex group may be observed to stiffen their ears in different contexts.In general, Ears-Stiff indicates than an elephant is Attentive, Vigilant or engaged in interaction with another elephant. Listening, Freezing, Contemplating elephants all display Ears-Stiff. Ears-Stiff is a component of the Musth-Constellation as well as Wariness in Estrous-Females.References:Poole and Moss 1981; Poole 1982: 77, illustration 4.7; Poole 1987a: 298 drawing; Poole 1999a; Poole & Granli 2011 [Ears-Tense, Ear-Cocking, Ear-Stiffening].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Eyes-Wide (0),"Opening the eyes wide, sometime exposing the ‘white’ of the eye. An elephant normally casts is eyes downward. An alarmed, frightened or highly excited elephant may open its eyes wide. Eye-Widening may also be seen during intense Affiliative and excited Social Play contexts.References:Poole 1996: 41, 54; 154, 155; Poole 2000a; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011 [Eye-Widening].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Follow (0),"Walking after, trying to maintain close proximity, though not necessarily physical contact, to another individual.In a Calf Reassurance & Protection context infants and calves typically Follow their mothers or other care-givers. Infants are born with an innate drive to Follow and they walk after the wrong individual. Mothers and allomothers are, thus, primarily responsible for maintaining proximity to very young calves and are often seen to Follow and Retrieve them. In an Affiliative or Movement Space & Leadership context members of a family Follow the lead of adult females, as in during Movement-Initiation. During Social-Play elephants may Follow one another as they cavort and Spar with one another. In the Context of Courtship a guarding male may Follow an estrous female, or an estrous female may Follow a high ranking male. In this particular case, where the distance between the pair and who is responsible for mainting proximity, changes in a predictable way depending on how many competitors there are and as the course of estrus progresses, the behavior is referred to as Maintain-Proximity.References:Lee 1987, Poole 1989b, 2011, Poole & Granli 2011. (Full reference list)",https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-ethogram/ethogram-table/behavior?id=358&cvid=
AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Food-Sharing (1),"An individual sharing food with another or others. For example: a male (typically in musth) sharing a tree he has felled with others (usually females and calves); an individual purposefully dropping food, offering food, or putting food into the mouth of another individual who is begging vocally or gesturally (see Solicit-Food) or to one who is incapacitated (e.g. missing most of trunk due to snaring), sick, dying or dead (for the latter see Body-Feeding).References:Poole & Granli 2021.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Grasp-Tail (1),"Using the trunk to briefly grasp the tail of another. This is perhaps most commonly observed during social play, but males may sometimes grasp the tail of an estrous female, and mothers may hold the tails of their infants apparently to get their attention.References:Moss 1988; Poole 1996: p 274; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011. (Full reference list)",https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-ethogram/ethogram-table/behavior?id=112&cvid=MTIwMQ==
AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Grasp-Trunk (0),"Using the trunk to grasp the trunk of another. This is most often observed when mothers and allomothers grasp the trunk of a newborn, apparently to get its attention back to the mother or allomother, for instance to induce it to Follow, or to Suckle, or to Help it. For example, we observed an allomother grasp and lift the trunk of an infant who was submerged and appeared to be drowning; a mother who grasped the trunk of an infant who was sneezing; as well as mothers who grasped the trunks and covered the mouths of calves Crying in distress. Mothers and allomothers are often observed to grasp the trunks of newborns apparently directing them to Suckle, using the behavior to lift the head of the infant toward the breast, or to Follow, doing the same together with a Trunk-Sweep motion and steps forward. One video shows a male moving an infant out of the way by grasping it by the trunk in an attempt to move it to the side. Grasp-Trunk has also been observed in an unusual situation in which an adolescent female repeatedly grasped the trunk of a younger brother to engage in Allo-Trunk-Sucking. Grasp-Trunk is also often observed in the context of Social Play. Grasp-Trunk may also be observed when elephants are highly aroused and gathered together in a Bonding-Ceremony, when Reach-Touch may become a brief Grasp-Trunk.References:Poole 2011, Poole & Granli 2021.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Greeting-Rumble (7),"An explosive burst of long (~5-7 seconds) powerful, throaty, highly modulated and overlapping rumbles when members of a social group come together after a period of more prolonged separation. We refer to these calls as Greeting-Rumbles. Typically, participants approach one another face to face and then, when they meet one another, may turn or Pirouette to stand in parallel while Head-Raising, Ear-Lifting, and streaming with Temporin. Audible Rapid-Ear-Flapping may be heard as the calling continues and the participants may Urinate and Defecate, and may engage in Tusk-Clicking, Open-Mouth-to-Open-Mouth, High-Fiving and reciprocal Trunk-to-Mouth. After the initial explosive greeting, an exchange of lower intensity and less modulated Rumbles continues as the greeting proceeds.References:Moss 1981; Poole & Moss 1983; Poole et al 1988; Poole 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Head-Raising (7),"Raising the head during an excited, affiliative interaction such as a Little-Greeting, Greeting, Caressing, Coalition formation. It is typically associated with affiliative vocalizations, including, but not limited to the Little-Greeting-Rumble, Greeting-Rumble, Coo-Rumble, As-Touched-Rumble, Female-Chorus, Mating-Pandemonium, Coalition-Rumbling. This posture is different from Head-High in that the elephant's neck appears to be extended upwards and outwards so that the head appears more separate from the rest of the body. In the Head-High posture the elephant's neck is extended upward but not outward. Head-Raising is observed in all age/sex groups except adult males.References:Poole 1996: 93; Payne, 2003; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Head-Rub (0),An elephant rubs another with his or her head.References:Goldenberg & Wittemyer 2018. (Full reference list),https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-ethogram/ethogram-table/behavior?id=336&cvid=
AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Head-Shaking (3),"An abrupt shaking of the head, which causes the ears to flap sharply and dust to fly. Head-Shaking usually starts by the elephant twisting the head to one side and then rapidly rotating it from side to side. The ears slap against the side of the face or neck making a loud smacking sound.Head-Shaking occurs in a broad range of contexts. It can be a sign of an individual's annoyance with or disapproval of an individual or circumstance. It can be used as a threat to other elephants or in confrontations with predators, as well as in play in feign annoyance. It also occurs during intense social events such as Greeting-Ceremonies or the arrival of an awaited individual.Head-Shaking may also occur after a longish period of contemplation - as if the individual has considered something and the Head-Shake is an outward expression of those feelings. Head-Shaking also typically follows a bout of mud-splashing or mud wallowing.This behavior is observed in all age/sex groups except during Affiliative bonding behavior in which it is limited to female adults, adolescents, juveniles and calves.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Eltringham 1982; Poole 1987a; Moss 1988; Moss 1992: 129; Payne & Langbauer 1992; Poole 1996: 147; Langbauer 2000; Poole & Granli 2003.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Lifting (1),"Using the feet, tusks or trunk to attempt to lift or carry an infant, to get it to its feet, up a bank, out of a well, or similar predicament, or to assist a helpless, injured, dying or dead elephant. For dead elephants see Lift-Body. In the context of calves or infants this is exclusively an adult female behavior, although adolescent and juvenile females certainly assist calves and may attempt to lift them. Adult males and females may attempt to lift injured, dying or dead elephants.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Moss 1992: 123, 124, 129; Poole 1996: 95, 98 137, 159; Payne, 2003; McComb et al 2006; Bates et al 2008; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011 [see also Body-Lifting].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Little-Greeting-Rumble (13),"A Rumbling, greeting exchange between members of an elephant family in which one (usually older and female) approaches another (usually younger, in parallel and from behind). Typically, the approaching elephant emits a soft, tonal Rumble of medium duration (2.5-4 seconds) to which the elephant being approached, responds by Head-Raising, Ear-Lifting and sometimes Backing-Towards the approaching elephant and emitting a responding, more noisy Rumble of medium duration and moderate intensity (although these are highly variable). Often both individuals Head-Raise and Ear-Lift and the two may Social-Rub against one another, touch one another or greet Trunk-to-Mouth. Both are likely to secrete Temporin. This interchange is a relatively frequent event in an elephant family and we refer to it as Little-Greeting-Rumbles. Examination of spectrograms indicate that in almost every case both the approaching and approached elephant call (although the softer call of the former may be drowned out by the more powerful call of the latter) and that their Rumbles overlap. In some cases nearby elephants may also join in. Elephants may also call in this manner when one approaches another face to face, although this pattern is less common.Little-Greeting-Rumbles may occur between any member of an elephant family, including between two males, but they are most commonly heard between females. Little-Greetings occur more often between mother-daughter, sister-sister, grandmother-granddaughter pairs than expected by chance, and less often between aunt-niece, great-grandmother-great-granddaughter or pairs who were second cousins. Yet, some exchanges aunt-niece pairs show a high frequency of Little-Greeting-Rumble exchanges. In each case these are pairs in which the niece was an infant prior to the aunt having her first calf, and the aunt was the most likely candidate in the family for taking the role of allomother. Calves and their caretakers (often sisters and aunts) emit Coo-Rumble and As-Touched-Rumble exchanges under rather similar circumstances to Little-Greeting-Rumble exchanges and we believe that the Coo-Rumble and As-Touched-Rumble probably develops into a Little-Greeting-Rumble relationship.We venture to propose that the relationships established through early vocal and tactile care-giving by mothers, sisters and other allomothers form the basis of close bonds observed as adults which are then strengthened and reinforced through the customary Little-Greetings between closely bonded pairs. The care-takers who looked after the Tsavo orphans were able to elicit the same type of answer Rumbles from the orphaned calves by individually calling out their names. Members of an elephant family appear to use this common vocal exchange as a way of saying something like 'hello, its good to be near you again' or, perhaps, 'you are important to me'.References:Poole 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Nasal-Throb (0),"A throbbing or fluttering movement in the forehead of an elephant at the position where the nasal passages enter the skull (located in the center of the forehead just above the eyes), which occurs when air is pulsating through the nasal passages. This is particularly visible when a large adult male gives a deep throbbing Musth-Rumble. In some cases dust on the forehead can be dislodged by the movement and become airborne. Occasionally throbbing of the forehead can be detected when an adult female Rumbles. This fluttering is more apparent in Asian elephants who have a prominant bulge at the location where the nasal passages enter the skull.References:Payne et al 1986, Poole & Granli 2021. (Full reference list)",https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-ethogram/ethogram-table/behavior?id=382&cvid=
AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Nasal-Trumpet (1),"A nasal sounding trumpet of less than a second in duration that is noisier and significantly lower in frequency than all other trumpets. Nasal-Trumpets are most often associated with very exuberant play and sound like a large man blowing his nose. They may also be given by highly aroused individuals during social bonding events, such as Greetings. It seems that Nasal-Trumpeting participants may force air more slowly through the upper part of the nasal passages causing it to reverberate down the length of the trunk at a lower frequency. Calves, juveniles, adolescents and adults are all capable of producing these trumpets.References:Poole & Granli 2004; Poole 2011. (Full reference list)",https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-ethogram/ethogram-table/behavior?id=166&cvid=MTE4NA==
AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Open-Mouth (2),"Opening the mouth. Covered by the trunk the mouths of elephants are not very obvious sources of visual displays, but during excited vocal interactions elephants open their mouths wide, often holding their trunks curved upward, exposing the mouth. During many social interactions elephants become highly aroused, opening their mouths to Rumble, Roar or scream at very high sound pressure levels. Typically, Open-Mouth indicates vocalization, but Open-Mouth is also observed during Sparring when elephants raise their trunks over the heads. Open-Mouth may also be observed during aggressive interactions, when an elephant, often an adult female, may hold her mouth open as she aggressively follows another. It is possible that she is producing a very low frequency vocalization, but often the mouth is held open for a longer time than would be typical of a Rumble.All age/sex groups may be observed displaying Open-Mouth, but it is much more common among female elephants than among males. Males might be observed exhibiting Open-Mouth when Roaring in protest in a Submissive context, while females show Open-Mouth in Affiliative, Aggressive, Movement Space & Leadership, Coalition Building, Birth, Advertisement & Attraction and Submission contexts. Infants and calves will exhibit Open-Mouth in a Calf Protection and Reassurance context.References:Poole et al 1988; Poole 1996: 275; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011 [Mouth-Opening].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Pirouette (0),"Spinning or pivoting around, so as to turn rapidly toward and away from others. Pirouetting may be displayed by highly aroused individuals during exuberant Social Play or between adult and adolescent females during intense Affiliative or Coalition Building events or other Bonding behavior (such as Greeting-Ceremonies), when relatives come together in a close cluster Head-Raising, Ear-Lifting and Rapid-Ear-Flapping, vocalizing, Urinating and Defecating.Pirouetting is likely an extreme form of Reach-Touch where elephants may turn rapidly to reach out to with their trunks to closely bonded companions.References:Poole 1982: 37; Moss 1988; Poole 1996; Payne 2003; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011 [Spinning, Pirouette-Run].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Rapid-Ear-Flapping (4),"Flapping the ears vigorously and rapidly in a raised position. Rapid-Ear-Flapping is usually associated with Head-Raising and Ear-Folding. This behavior is almost always seen in the context of greeting or bonding interactions that involve chorused calling such as Bonding-Ceremonies, Coalitions, High-Fiving, End-Zone-Dance, Female-Choring, Greeting-Ceremonies, Mating-Pandemoniums. In Coalition Building and Advertisement & Attraction contexts this behavior is observed among adult, adolescent and juvenile females; In Affiliative contexts female calves also participate.References:Moss 1981; Poole 1982: 37, 50; Moss 1988; Poole et al 1988; Poole 1998; Poole & Granli 2003; Payne, 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Reach-Touch (0),"Swinging of the trunk and body during intense social arousal to touch nearest neighbor relatives during Bonding, Coalition and Bunching behavior. Sometimes the reaching and touching may include Grasp-Trunk. The elephant(s) usually secrete Temporin and rumble softly to one another, while Head-Raising, Ear-Lifting and Rapid-Ear-Flapping. Engaged in primarily by adult and adolescent females.References:Poole 1982; Moss 1988; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011 [Trunk-Grasping].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Rest-Head (2),"An elephant resting his or her head on another. Rest-Head often occurs during play when one elephant rests his or her head on the back or flank of another. It is also often observed in a resting group when one elephant rests his or her head on a nearby elephant. In Courtship a male may Rest-Head on an estrous female as a prelude to Mounting. On rarer occasions a female may Rest-Head on another female in a display of dominance. On several occasions we have observed this behavior in the presence of a newborn infant, sometimes during an attempted kidnapping, when a dominant female places her head on the back of a younger mother.References:Poole & Granli 2003; Goldenberg and Wittemyer 2018 [Rest-Chin].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Sashay (2),"An elephant taking exaggerated sideways steps, to manoeuvre rapidly into a new position that is immediately to the elephant’s left or right. This movement is classically seen by adult males (usually in musth) during Duelling or Escalated-Contests where a male tries to manoeuvre himself into a better position. It may similarly be observed among males during Sparring.Further, Sashaying may be observed among adult, adolescent and juvenile females as members of a family jockey for a better position during Affiliative behavior such as a Bonding-Ceremony, or by an adult female - or male - during Attacking or Mobbing behavior.References:Poole & Granli 2021.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Snort (0),"A short (typically less than a second in duration), sharp, noisy, broadband sound produced by purposefully blowing air through the trunk. Elephants may Snort when they are surprised or annoyed by something, or indignant about something another has done, or during intense social excitement. In these contexts Snorts may be less explosive Trumpets, which are also given in similar contexts. Elephants may also Snort apparently to alert other members of their group to a new situation.A Snort is audibly distinguishable from the more common Blow or Sneeze (blowing, sneezing, wheezing, and coughing sounds) that appears to be made for the purpose of clearing the nasal passages. A Snort sounds sharper and more purposeful than a Blow and may also be distinguished by context.Humans snort in similar circumstances.According to the Cambridge English Dictionary a Snort is an explosive sound made by forcing air up or down the nose; to suddenly express strong feelings of anger, disapproval, or disagreement. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary adds that a snort is used to express scorn, anger, indignation, derision, incredulity or surprise.References:Berg 1983; Leong et al 2003; Stoeger-Horwath et al 2007; Poole 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Social-Rubbing (6),"Approaching a stationary individual from behind and rubbing the head, ear, shoulder and/or flank against the standing individual. This behavior is used in an affiliative context and occurs most often between closely bonded individuals. Infants and calves may use a stationary elephant (especially the mother) like a tree stump on which to vigorously rub. Calves may also Social-Rub against their mother to Solicit-Food or Solicit-Suckling, as if in appeasement.Particularly younger animals may Social-Rub during Social Play when they engage in pushing, leaning and rubbing against the body, head or legs of another, who may be standing, kneeling or lying down.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: 112; Lee 1986, 1987; Moss 1988; Poole 1996: 275; Payne 2003; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011 [Rub]; Goldenberg & Wittemyer 2018.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Social-Trumpet (2),"Trumpets occurring within the context of intense social interactions such as a Greeting-Ceremony, Mating-Pandemonium, Birth, or other Bonding-Ceremony. Social-Trumpets last less than a second in duration and are typically, or possibly exclusively, produced by females of all age classes, except infants. Structurally, Social-Trumpets are not significantly different from Play-Trumpets although they are significantly different from the other Trumpet context-types.Social-Trumpeting individuals overlap with the lower frequency Rumbling produced by other participants in a social interaction. We propose that Social-Trumpets function as a sort of exclamation mark, helping to define the level of significance of an event. While the type of Rumbling may indicate of the type of event (e.g. mating, greeting, conflict), we believe that the frequency, and perhaps even the placement, of Social-Trumpets may be an indication of the level of excitement and importance that the elephants collectively confer on an event. In a sense, the use of Social-Trumpets might be viewed as a simple form of syntax qualifying the sequence of calls. More research is clearly needed.References:Poole 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Tail-Raising (0),"Raising the tail. The tail of a relaxed elephant hangs down. Fearful, highly playful or sexually or socially aroused elephants typically raise their tails. All age/sex groups Tail-Raise in Vigilant and Avoidance contexts; female adults, adolescents and calves Tail-Raise in Affiliative and Courtship contexts and female adults and adolescents Tail-Raise in Coalition Building contexts.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Moss 1988; Poole 1996: 41, 154; Poole 1999a; Payne, 1998; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Temporin (3),"Streaming of secretion from the temporal glands of non-musth elephants. Temporin may be ephemeral or sustained and is more frequently observed among females. Many socially stimulating interactions within families are associated with the sudden onset of Temporin among adult females and, most often, their female offspring. These secretions may stream down the side of the face within seconds of the onset of the interaction. In these cases the onset of Temporin usually appears to be associated with vocalizing and typically dries within 10-15 minutes.In East African populations, our observation is that sustained Temporin is more likely to be observed among females and when they are separated from their families or when individuals are disturbed. In these habitats Temporin is more frequently observed in the dry season, due, we believe to the fact that relatives are forced to split into smaller groups.In Gorongosa, Mozambique, this pattern does not hold. Most elephants, no matter the age or sex, secrete from the temporal glands during both dry and wetter periods, and when they are in large and small groups. While the population is fearful and aggressive toward people, we do not believe that stress is the reason for the difference observed. Much more research is needed to understand the function of Temporin among elephants.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Moss 1981; Poole & Moss 1981; Moss 1988; Poole 1982: 61; Poole et al 1988; Poole 1996: 93, 137, 275; Payne 2003; Poole & Granli 2003; McComb et al. 2003; Poole & Granli 2011; [Streaming, Temporal-Gland-Secretion & (wrongly) Musth].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Touch-Self (2),"Self-directed touching of the face (mouth, ear, trunk, tusk or temporal gland) or chest, with the fingers or tip of the trunk. Very often in the context of an interaction with another elephant, but may be seen in any context where an elephant appears uneasy or stressed. Likely analogous to the way we might scratch our head or rub our face when feeling socially or otherwise uncomfortable or unsure.References:Kühme 1961; Poole 1999a; Poole & Granli 2003; Kahl & Armstrong 2000 [Touch-Face].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Trumpet (0),"A forceful expulsion of air through the trunk, creating a trumpeting sound. Trumpets come in several forms. Trumpets are mainly tonal sounds, though harmonics are overlaid with noise. Most last less than a second (though extremely long trumpets may last over three seconds), with fundamental frequencies falling around 300 Hz and peak energy concentrated at approximately 450 Hz. An elephant can produce a wide variety of sounds by varying the speed of air she forces through her trunk, by the shape in which she holds her trunk, and by her own body posture and movement.Elephants tend to trumpet when they are highly stimulated—in situations in which they may be fearful, surprised, aggressive, playful, or socially aroused — and the quality of trumpeting varies with the context. Trumpeting is often associated with intensely social events such as a birth, mating, or greeting ceremony, where group participation is important. In these situations we postulate that rumbling may define the context (e.g., greeting, mating, etc.) while trumpeting may function as a kind of “exclamation mark,” expressing the very high level of excitement and stressing the importance of the event.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Berg 1983, Leong et al 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Stoeger-Horwath et al 2007; Poole 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Trunk-to-Face (3),"Reaching of the trunk to touch, or near touch the face of another. Trunk-to-Face is a common behavior and occurs between elephants of all age/sex groups in a broad range of contexts and may include Trunk-to-Temporal-Gland, Trunk-to-Ear. In a Calf Reassurance & Protection context, Trunk-to-Face is a common component of Caressing behavior displayed by mothers and allomothers toward infants and calves to bond with, reassure and protect them. Mothers also appear to use Trunk-to-Face to get the attention of infants before moving on or in an attempt to Guide them toward or away from something. During Social Play, Affiliative as well as other contexts elephants also reach the trunk to the face of other elephants, often in the area of the temporal glands and the mouth.This behavior is often observed during Sparring and following meeting/greeting of individuals. Elephants are very tactile animals with a tremendously perceptive sense of smell. More research is required to fully understand why elephants touch different parts of the faces of other elephants.References:Poole 1982: 37 illustration; Rasmussen & Wittemyer 2002; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004, Poole & Granli 2011 [Test-Temporal-Glands]; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011 [Trunk to head & Trunk to temporal glands].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Trunk-to-Genitals (4),"Reaching of the trunk to touch, or near touch the genitals of another. Trunk-to-Genitals is a common behavior and occurs between elephants of all age/sex groups in a broad range of contexts. It is likely that such behaviour is often related to assessment of physical or sexual state, such as male assessment of female receptivity and female and male assessment of male musth state, or assessing the physical state of an infant.Yet, it is not always the case that this behavior has an olfactory function. For instance calves Soliciting-Suckling have been observed to touch and even ‘pinch’ their mother’s genitals in an action that appears to be aimed at getting her attention. Likewise, mothers and allomothers touch the genitals of infants, apparently to get their attention before moving off or in an attempt to Guide them toward or away from something. Mothers and allomothers also regularly touch the genitals of infants in what appears to be a gesture of reassurance.Trunk-to-Genitals often occurs during greetings between various age/sex individuals and during Sparring mostly between males. Elephants are very tactile animals with a tremendously perceptive sense of smell. More research is required to fully understand why elephants touch the genitals of other elephants.References:Jainudeen et al 1971; Eisenberg et al 1971; Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Poole 1982: 37 illustration & 174; Poole 1987b; Rasmussen et al 1982; Rasmussen & Wittemyer 2002; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011 [Test-Genitals; Test-Penis].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Trunk-to-Mouth (25),"Reaching of the trunk to touch or near touch, or place into the mouth of another. Trunk-to-Mouth is a very common elephant behavior and occurs between elephants of all age/sex groups in a broad range of contexts.In an Aggressive context Trunk-to-Mouth appears to be a Conciliatory gesture. In an Affiliative context between both relatives and non-relatives Trunk-to-Mouth as well as Reciprocal-Trunk-to-Mouth is observed during all manner of Greeting and Bonding situations.In a Coalition Building context, Trunk-to-Mouth as well as Reciprocal-Trunk-to-Mouth is commonly observed when elephants bunch together to face off a common threat and appears to function in reinforcing bonds and reassuring one another.In a Calf Reassurance & Protection context, Trunk-to-Mouth is a common component of Caressing behavior displayed by mothers and allomothers toward infants and calves during care, reassurance and protection. Mothers may also use Trunk-to-Mouth to get the attention of infants before moving off or in an attempt to Guide them toward or away from something. In some cases mothers use an exaggerated movement in which they touch the infant’s mouth and then drawing the infants head up and in the correct direction by sliding the along the underside of the infants trunk. A mother may also cover the mouth of a crying infant with her trunk fingers as if to console.In a Calf Nourishment & Weaning context infants and calves use Trunk-to-Mouth to Solicit-Food from their mothers or others.In a Social Play context Trunk-to-Mouth as well as Reciprocal-Trunk-to-Mouth is observed particularly during Sparring.The above is a cursory description of one of the most quintessential elephant behaviors and much research is needed to understand the full function of this gentle gesture.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Buss, Rasmussen & Smuts 1976; Moss 1981; Lee 1986; Lee 1987; Poole 1982; Poole 1996: 137; Rasmussen 1988; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011 [Test-Mouth].

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Trunk-Twining (0),"A mutual entwining of trunks. Trunk-Twining occurs in Social Play as a gentle contact form of Sparring, during which two elephants slowly and sinuously intertwine their trunks in a spiral. Trunk-Twining also occurs during Coalition Building and Affiliative contexts during High-Fiving and in a range of Bonding-Ceremonies between adult females, where the action can be more sudden and dramatic. In some cases the intertwining of trunks can be more like a sudden clasping of another’s trunk.References:Moss 1981; Poole 1982: 35; Lee 1987; Moss 1988; Kahl & Armstrong 2000; Payne 2003; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Tusk-Clank (0),"During Sparring, Dueling, Greeting or during the formation of Coalitions, such as High-Fiving or End-Zone-Dance, elephants may click or clank their tusks together. In affiliative and coalition building contexts this has been referred to as Tusk-Clicking, but the sound is much more of a clank during Sparring or Dueling. In the former two or more closely allied elephants may stand either parallel or face-to-face, adopting Head-Raising, Open-Mouth-to-Open-Mouth, and Trunk-Twining may (apparently purposefully) click their tusks together.This form of Tusk-Clicking or Clanking occurs during intense social interactions such as High-Fiving, Bonding-Ceremonies or during interactions in which an elephant wishes to express solidarity with a friend or family member such as during a Greeting, Coalition Building or an End-Zone-Dance. In this context the participants are adult or adolescent females. Tusk-Clanking also occurs during Sparring when two males, or a male and a female, stand face to face, also Head-Raising, Open-Mouth-to-Open-Mouth, and Trunk-Twining, their tusks clicking together. Further, elephants will clank their tusks together as weapons as they Duel.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Moss 1988; Payne 2003; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Urinating (1),"The term Urinating refers to normal elimination as well as social or sexual responses. Normal elimination may stimulate others to Urinate. For instance when a group wakes up from Resting, most individuals may Urinate and Defecate.In an Advertisement & Attraction or Courtship context, such as during Trunk-to-Genitals, Female-Chorus or Mating-Pandemonium, female adults, adolescents and juveniles will typically Urinate when a male, particularly one in musth, uses his trunk to touch or sniff her genitals, in response to the arrival of a musth male in the group, or during or following a Mating.Extreme social arousal such as during High-Fiving, Greetings, or a variety of other Bonding-Ceremonies also stimulates female adults, adolescents and juveniles to Urinate. During these sexual and social contexts Urinating is typically associated with vocalising, and several females may Urinate simultaneously.References:Poole 1982: 37; Moss 1988; Poole et al 1988; Poole 1996: 275; Poole & Granli 2003.

AffiliativeBehaviors relating to the formation and maintenance of social bonds with other elephants.,Yawn (0),"An elephant opening its mouth wide and taking in a deep breath. In humans yawning is usually an involuntary reaction to fatigue or boredom, or can be a reaction to stress or anxiety. Yawning can be contagious.While spontaneous Yawning is common across all vertebrates, contagious Yawning is less common and has only been observed in a few species of social animals. Interspecific contagious Yawning has only been observed between humans and chimpanzees, dogs and, most recently, elephants.References:Rossman et al 2021.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Advance-Toward (13),"Purposeful, directed walking with hostile intent toward another elephant(s), or toward a perceived non-elephant threat, that typically results in sumissive or avoidance behavior or counter threat. The term includes an Advance-Toward of a single step to a persistent, prolonged and highly aggressive pursuit at a fast walk. The latter often follows an Escalated-Contest when one male has signalled defeat by fleeing.Advance-Toward may be associated with other aggressive behaviors such as Head-High, Ear-Spreading, or Ear-Folding, Ear-Slap, Ear-Waving, Bow-Neck, Kick-Dust etc.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972; Mkay 1973: 63, 65; Poole 1982: 129; Poole 1987a; Moss 1988; Poole 1989a; Poole 1992; Ben-Shahar 1999: 299; Poole & Granli 2003.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Bow-Neck (0),"An aggressor lowering the head and bowing the neck downward and simultaneously tilting the head upward so that the tusks are approximately horizontal to the ground. In a sense the aggressor brings head/tusks down to the victim's level. It is one of the more common forms of high-level aggression between females of different families or toward young, pesky non-family males and may be seen as a component of a coalition. It is commonly directed by females at non-elephant threats (including humans). In these contexts the “Bow-Neck” posture may be associated with Ear-Slapping and/or Ear-Folding and is typically accomplished at a fast walk. It may precede or be part of a Bow-Neck-Charge, especially when the receiver is of smaller stature than the aggressor.The posture is also observed in playful contexts by all age sex groups. It is often a component of Charging in a playful context. It is reminiscent of the “Forward Threat Display"" of geese.References:Kahl & Armstrong 2000; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Ear-Folding (13),"Forcing the lower half of ear under and back so that a prominent horizontal ridge or fold appears across the ear. In an Aggressive or Attacking context it may be used by male and female adults, adolescents, juveniles and calves in combination with a variety of other threats such as Head-High, Look-At, Advance-Toward, Charge, etc. to emphasize that an elephant “means business.”Ear-Folding can be either a short or a persistent display, the later indicating a ""foul mood"" or ""testiness"". Ear-Folding that is used in association with Head-Raising, Ear-Lifting or Rapid-Ear-Flapping is part of an Affiliative or Coalition Building display exhibited by adult, adolescent and juvenile females.References:Poole 1982: 86, illustration 6.1; Poole, 1987a; Moss 1988; Poole 1989a; Poole 1996: 75, 77, 128, 133; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Ear-Slap (9),"Slapping the ears loudly and sharply against the neck and shoulders. In a Movement Space and Leadership and Avoidance context this gestures is typically made by an older female, often the matriarch, who appears to use it to call attention to her location and (changing) activity or movement. In Aggressive, Coalition Building or Attacking & Mobbing contexts, it is used in association with Ear-Folding as an elephant Advances-Toward its adversary.References:Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Ear-Spreading (0),"Standing or moving with the ears fully extended at ~90 degrees from body. An elephant normally holds its ears in a relaxed position such that they rest approximately 10-30 cm from the side of the body. In this relaxed position the ears do not appear stiff or tense, lifted, spread, or pressed against the body.Elephants may Ear-Spread when facing an opponent, predator or presumed threat, presumably for the purpose of appearing larger. Elephants may also spread their ears when they are Listening, surprised, alarmed or otherwise aroused. All age sex groups engage in Ear-Spreading.References:Kühme 1961; Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; McKay 1973; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011 [Ear-Extension, Ears held out].

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Ear-Wave (0),"A musth male swings the upper portion of the ear stiffly and vigorously forward and backward. The speed and forcefulness of the swinging causes the lower, unsupported portion of the pinnae to flap even further forward and backward and upward. The motion creates a wave appearance across the ear. Ear-Waving is typically associated with Musth-Rumbling and may serve to waft scent of Musth-Temporal-Gland-Secretion toward other elephants.References:Poole 1982: 86; Poole 1987a: 294 drawing; Poole 1996: 122; Kahl & Armstrong 2002: 162 photo; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Foot-Scuffing (0),"An individual taking short, shallow steps and purposefully dragging or scuffing the soles of the feet on the ground to create sound. Foot-Scuffing is often used by musth males at close range. Together with visual, vocal and chemical signals, the approaching scuffing steps adds to the male’s ominous display. In a Social Play context, Foot-Scuffing may be employed by Charging youngsters. In an Attacking & Mobbing context Foot-Scuffing may be employed by Charging adults, again for the audible effect.References:Poole & Granli 2021.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Forward-Trunk-Swing (2),"A swinging or tossing of the trunk in the direction of an adversary typically while simultaneously blowing forcefully out through the trunk. Elephants may swing their trunks at other elephants or at smaller animals (e.g. egrets; ground-hornbills; warthogs, people) as a threat, to chase them away, or in play. Forward-Trunk-Swing may be employed by all age sex groups.References:Kühme 1961; Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6 [Forward-Trunk-Swish], 100; Poole 1987a; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004, Poole & Granli 2011; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011 [Trunk throw].

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Head-High (3),"Standing or moving with head held well above shoulders, chin tucked in (Chin-In), so that the elephant looks squarely at its adversary with ears and tusks held more perpendicular to the ground. Typically, the ears are maximally forward (Ear-Spreading). This posture is used primarily to threaten other elephants, particularly by males in musth.References:Eisenberg, McKay & Jainudeen 1971; Poole 1982: 77 & illustration 4.7, Moss 1983; Poole 1987a; Poole 1987b; Poole 1987c; Poole 1988; Poole 1992; Poole 1996: 75, 77; Poole 1997; Poole & Granli 2003; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011 [Head held up].

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Head-Shaking (2),"An abrupt shaking of the head, which causes the ears to flap sharply and dust to fly. Head-Shaking usually starts by the elephant twisting the head to one side and then rapidly rotating it from side to side. The ears slap against the side of the face or neck making a loud smacking sound.Head-Shaking occurs in a broad range of contexts. It can be a sign of an individual's annoyance with or disapproval of an individual or circumstance. It can be used as a threat to other elephants or in confrontations with predators, as well as in play in feign annoyance. It also occurs during intense social events such as Greeting-Ceremonies or the arrival of an awaited individual.Head-Shaking may also occur after a longish period of contemplation - as if the individual has considered something and the Head-Shake is an outward expression of those feelings. Head-Shaking also typically follows a bout of mud-splashing or mud wallowing.This behavior is observed in all age/sex groups except during Affiliative bonding behavior in which it is limited to female adults, adolescents, juveniles and calves.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Eltringham 1982; Poole 1987a; Moss 1988; Moss 1992: 129; Payne & Langbauer 1992; Poole 1996: 147; Langbauer 2000; Poole & Granli 2003.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Look-Back (0),"Standing or walking away while looking back over the shoulder. As an elephant Looks-Back it may flatten an ear against its body and turn its head in order to see what is behind it. This behavior is observed in numerous contexts.In Aggressive contexts by dominant individual Look-Back is a threat (as in ‘Watch it - I can see you!’). In a Submissive context a subordinate individual typically Looks-Back when retreating from an aggressive elephant.In Vigilance and Avoidance contexts, similarly, by high ranking elephant engaged in Rear-Guard (‘Watch out, I have my eye on you!’) or by retreating fearful elephants to monitor the location of a perceived threat. In a Calf Protection and Reassurance context during the Shepherding and Guiding of infants, mothers and allomothers Look-Back to see whether an infant is following or needs care or assistance. In a Courtship context an estrus female will Look-Back to monitor the presence, proximity and activity of pursuing or Guarding males. In a Space Movement and Leadership context individuals Look-Back when Waiting for or Guiding others, to see whether they are following. For example, Look-Back may be observed during the Let’s-Go-Stance.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6, 139; Poole 1996: 41; Poole 1987a; Poole 1989a; Poole 1999a; Kahl & Armstrong 2000; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Lunge (5),"A sudden forward thrust of the body and tusks, often with the trunk outstretched, to attack another. May be observed in Social Play, Aggressive and Attacking and Mobbing contexts. In the two former contexts all age/sex groups may be observed to Lunge at another elephant. In Attacking and Mobbing such behavior in the wild is likely limited to adult male and female elephants.References:O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Musth-Rumble (1),"A moderately long (~4-5 seconds in duration), very low frequency, distinctive rumble with a characteristically pulsating ‘put-put-put’ or ‘glug-glug-glug’ quality, only produced by an adult male during his heightened sexual and aggressive period of musth. Known as a Musth-Rumble, this call is associated with an increase in the rate of Urine-Dribbling and a particular ear flapping known as Ear-Waving. The calls of individual males are distinctive. Some males Musth-Rumbles are of short duration, while those of others are very long; some have a rolling quality while others are more pulsated, or may sound like water gurgling through a deep tunnel. The ‘classic’ Musth-Rumble is a long, low, pulsated, tonal call with considerable overlaying noise.Male elephants tend to Musth-Rumble in specific contexts such as: During aggressive interactions with other males; when approaching a group of females; prior to and immediately after a Mating; when they Rub a tree with Temporal-Gland-Secretion, when Drinking, Mud-Splashing, or Mud-Wallowing, or in situations where they feel challenged. For example, the sound of another musth male, an approaching vehicle or even an airplane overhead is often enough to trigger a musth male to Musth-Rumble. Musth males also frequently Musth-Rumble before or after Listening, when they are presumably responding to distant elephant calls or using calling to search for potential mates.Musth males most often Musth-Rumble when they are alone, less often when they are in the company of females and least often when they are Guarding an estrous female. Since musth males often Listen after they Musth-Rumble, it is likely that they use Musth-Rumbles to advertize their heightened aggressive and sexual state to rival males and to potential mates. Females respond to the Musth-Rumbles of musth males by Female-Chorusing, so calling may help a male to locate groups of females. Once a male has located an estrous female he may have neither the need nor the desire to advertise his whereabouts.References:Poole 1982: 50, 51; Poole 1987; Poole et al 1988; Poole 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Musth-Trunk-Wrinkle (0),A small dent or ''wrinkle'' in the trunk in an unexpected location based on the curve of the trunk. Musth-Trunk-Wrinkles are typically seen on the trunks of male in musth. We are not able to say whether the Musth-Trunk-Wrinkle has any function or why it may occur during musth.References:Kahl & Armstrong 2002. (Full reference list),https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-ethogram/ethogram-table/behavior?id=328&cvid=
"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Open-Mouth (1),"Opening the mouth. Covered by the trunk the mouths of elephants are not very obvious sources of visual displays, but during excited vocal interactions elephants open their mouths wide, often holding their trunks curved upward, exposing the mouth. During many social interactions elephants become highly aroused, opening their mouths to Rumble, Roar or scream at very high sound pressure levels. Typically, Open-Mouth indicates vocalization, but Open-Mouth is also observed during Sparring when elephants raise their trunks over the heads. Open-Mouth may also be observed during aggressive interactions, when an elephant, often an adult female, may hold her mouth open as she aggressively follows another. It is possible that she is producing a very low frequency vocalization, but often the mouth is held open for a longer time than would be typical of a Rumble.All age/sex groups may be observed displaying Open-Mouth, but it is much more common among female elephants than among males. Males might be observed exhibiting Open-Mouth when Roaring in protest in a Submissive context, while females show Open-Mouth in Affiliative, Aggressive, Movement Space & Leadership, Coalition Building, Birth, Advertisement & Attraction and Submission contexts. Infants and calves will exhibit Open-Mouth in a Calf Protection and Reassurance context.References:Poole et al 1988; Poole 1996: 275; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011 [Mouth-Opening].

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Prolonged-Pursuit (4),"A persistent, prolonged and aggressive follow at a fast walk or run by one individual (usually in musth) after another (usually in musth). A pursuit often follows an escalated contest; when one male has signaled defeat by fleeing the victor initially Runs-After and then Pursues the defeated male for up to several kilometers. An elephant may also engage in Prolonged-Pursuit when seeing off vehicles.References:Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011 [Pursuit].

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Purposeful-Walk (0),"An elephant walking with long strides in a directed, intentional manner as if he or she has a goal in mind. The normal gait of an elephant is a slow ambling, sometimes meandering walk. Instead, this manner of walking is purposeful and is observed in situations where elephants have a particular destination (e.g. Group-March), or when they appear to be trying to draw attention to themselves to advertise their sexual state or condition (e.g. Estrous-Walk, Musth-Walk, Parallel-Walk) or in an act of leadership (for example during Guiding, Perpendicular-Walk). In this latter context one may observe sweeping motions of the trunk - Trunk-Sweep for added visual impact.Different age sex classes may be observed engaging in Purposeful-Walking depending upon the context: Musth males and estrous females in an Advertisement & Attraction context, adult males and females in Aggressive and Attacking & Mobbing contexts; adult females - as leaders - in Coalition Building, Movement Space & Leadership and Calf Protection & Reassurance contexts.References:Poole & Granli 2021.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Pushing (9),"Pushing the head or base of trunk into the back, side, head or trunk of another to move it away or along or to assist it. Pushing comes in different forms and may be rough in aggressive contexts or very gentle in a situation where an elephant is attempting to help, herd or shepherd a family member.All age/sex groups may be observed to Push in an Aggressive context; while adult, adolescent and juvenile females may Push in a Calf Reassurance & Protection context; and adult females in a Movement Space & Leadership context. Social Play context Pushing is most likely to involve males of all ages.References:Lee 1986; Moss 1988; Langbauer 2000; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011; O’Connell-Rodwell et al 2011 [including Herding-Push].

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Ramming (2),"Rushing at another with head lowered and trunk curved under (to expose tusks) and goring or poking it with the tusks. This is a serious attack with intent to harm. Elephants may receive serious wounds and or die from such attacks. While Ramming in an Aggressive context most often involves adult males, females also engage in Ramming. A female was seen with a broken off female tusk sticking out of the side of her body. In a Social Play context Ramming is most likely to be instigated by immature and young adult males. Adult males and females may Ram vehicles.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: 130; Kahl & Armstrong 2000; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Reaching-High (0),"At the end of a Run-After or a Charge when the attacker slows his or her pursuit, he or she may extend the trunk upward and outward toward the opponent or threat. This is a common display following a Run-After by a high-ranking male toward lower ranking male, often in association with an estrous female; a signal of triumph, as in ‘I’ve seen him off!’ It is also used by males during Dueling when males rush together, but stop short of Ramming one another.Reaching-High is also a common behavior following a Charge, Bow-Neck-Charge or Group-Charge by an adult female. All age/sex groups except infants may engage in Reaching-High in an Aggressive context; in an Attacking & Mobbing context it tends to be observed in adults of both sexes.References:Jainudeen et al 1972; Poole 1987b; Poole 1987c; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011; Kahl & Armstrong 2000 [also includes Trunk-Blocking & Trunk-Out-Stretched].

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Rest-Head (0),"An elephant resting his or her head on another. Rest-Head often occurs during play when one elephant rests his or her head on the back or flank of another. It is also often observed in a resting group when one elephant rests his or her head on a nearby elephant. In Courtship a male may Rest-Head on an estrous female as a prelude to Mounting. On rarer occasions a female may Rest-Head on another female in a display of dominance. On several occasions we have observed this behavior in the presence of a newborn infant, sometimes during an attempted kidnapping, when a dominant female places her head on the back of a younger mother.References:Poole & Granli 2003; Goldenberg and Wittemyer 2018 [Rest-Chin].

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Rumble (0),"A highly variable class or type of tonal vocalisations that is characterised by calls with very low fundamental frequencies. Rumbles are the most frequently heard call type in the repertoire of all age/sex classes of African savannah elephants and are easily distinguished from other types by their very low frequencies and clear harmonic structure. Fundamental frequencies range from 8-34 Hz depending upon the callers age, body size, arousal level and call context.Some rumbles are highly modulated, powerful sounds; others rise or fall in pitch; some rumble contours are flat, some undulating, and still others are jittery. Rumbles range in duration from less than half a second to almost 12 seconds and may be emitted as a soft fluttering whisper or an explosive throaty resonance with sound pressure levels up to 103 dB extrapolated to 5 m from source.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6 [Growl]; Berg 1983 [Growl]; Payne et al 1986; Leong et al 2003; Poole et al 1988; Stoeger-Horwath et al 2007; Poole 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Sashay (0),"An elephant taking exaggerated sideways steps, to manoeuvre rapidly into a new position that is immediately to the elephant’s left or right. This movement is classically seen by adult males (usually in musth) during Duelling or Escalated-Contests where a male tries to manoeuvre himself into a better position. It may similarly be observed among males during Sparring.Further, Sashaying may be observed among adult, adolescent and juvenile females as members of a family jockey for a better position during Affiliative behavior such as a Bonding-Ceremony, or by an adult female - or male - during Attacking or Mobbing behavior.References:Poole & Granli 2021.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Threat-Rumble (0),"A medium-long slightly undulating Rumble produced by adult females when aggressively Advancing-Toward other elephants. The Rumble is associated with Ear-Folding, pronounced Ear-Flapping with audible Ear-Slaps, and is typically given toward adult females or teenage males from other families. A female seriously threatening another elephant stretches her head forward and outward in a Bow-Neck, as she Advances-Toward or Runs-After her opponent.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Throw-Debris (0),"Grasping and lifting or uprooting vegetation, a rock or other object with the distal portion of the trunk and using movement of the entire trunk to throw or fling (underhand) the object in the direction of an opponent or predator. This behavior may also be observed in Social Play. An elephant's aim can be very accurate even at some distance. All age/sex groups except infants may be observed to Throw-Debris.References:Kühme 1961; Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Poole 1982: 51; Poole 1987a, Poole 1987c; Moss 1988; Poole 1996: 139, 148, 154, 157, 171; Kahl & Armstrong 2000; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Trumpet-Blast (1),"A powerful, relatively long and seemingly sustained, Trumpet lasting 1-1.5 seconds in duration produced when an elephant or group of elephants confronts a predator, or other perceived threat. An individual may Advance-Toward or Charge while Trumpeting. Referred to as a Trumpet-Blast these calls are intended to intimidate, and, typically, Charges that are associated with them end abruptly. Yet, in our experience, it is wise not to assume that a Trumpeting and Charging elephant will not make good her threat.Cavorting elephants Charging at or Running-After other species during Social Play (such as rabbits, hyenas, wildebeests, monkeys, or the human observer) typically Trumpet-Blast, too. While such Trumpets produced in the two contexts are similar, those produced when confronting a serious threat are more powerful and it is certainly possible to hear a difference between the two contexts.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Tusk-Clank (5),"During Sparring, Dueling, Greeting or during the formation of Coalitions, such as High-Fiving or End-Zone-Dance, elephants may click or clank their tusks together. In affiliative and coalition building contexts this has been referred to as Tusk-Clicking, but the sound is much more of a clank during Sparring or Dueling. In the former two or more closely allied elephants may stand either parallel or face-to-face, adopting Head-Raising, Open-Mouth-to-Open-Mouth, and Trunk-Twining may (apparently purposefully) click their tusks together.This form of Tusk-Clicking or Clanking occurs during intense social interactions such as High-Fiving, Bonding-Ceremonies or during interactions in which an elephant wishes to express solidarity with a friend or family member such as during a Greeting, Coalition Building or an End-Zone-Dance. In this context the participants are adult or adolescent females. Tusk-Clanking also occurs during Sparring when two males, or a male and a female, stand face to face, also Head-Raising, Open-Mouth-to-Open-Mouth, and Trunk-Twining, their tusks clicking together. Further, elephants will clank their tusks together as weapons as they Duel.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6; Moss 1988; Payne 2003; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2011.

"AggressiveBehaviors employed to intimidate, threaten or attack other elephants.",Tusk-Ground (0),"Bending or kneeling down and tusking the ground and, often, uplifting clods of soil and vegetation. When elephants engage in Mud-Wallowing they often Tusk-Ground. This is particularly true of Mud-Wallowing musth males who will engage in an exaggerated form of Tusk-Ground along with other components of a musth male display. In an Aggressive context Tusk-Ground is seen in the manoeuvring between two males during an Escalated-Contest, apparently as a demonstration of ‘look what I will do with you’.In an Attacking & Mobbing context an elephant may Kneel-Down and Tusk a person or other animal into the ground to kill or maim it. During Social Play elephants engage in a gentle form of both Kneel-Down and Tusk-Ground, behaviors that encourage other elephants to Climb-Upon.References:Kühme 1961; Poole 1982: 51, 57; Moss 1988; Poole 1987a; Poole 1987c; Poole 1996: 159; Poole & Granli 2003; Poole & Granli 2004; Poole & Granli 2011.

In some instances such ""adornment"" may be a consequence of foraging, for instance if an elephant submerges in a swamp and comes up under a clump of vegetation, it may end up lodged on its head or back. In other cases, the adornment is clearly purposeful as the elephant is seen to place the object on its body and work to keep it in position with its ears or trunk, and may replace it if it falls off.References:Poole & Granli 2021.

"AmbivalentBehaviors engaged in when an individual has simultaneous tendencies to perform two incompatible activities, such as fight or flight.",J-Trunk (1),"Holding the trunk in a relaxed position (hanging down, resting on the ground or over a trunk), but with the tip of the trunk curled under and around such that the trunk fingers point in the direction of an object of interest (often behind or to its side). As the individual sniffs the fingers of the trunk can be seen to partially open and close. This behavior is a component of a number of Attentive, Vigilant behavioral constellations. J-Trunk is a subtle form of sniffing and appears to be used when the individual would not necessarily have reason to make others aware of his or her object of interest or plan.For example, J-Trunk is typical of a young male around an estrus female, who may wish not to alert higher ranking males of his intentions. In contrast, Periscope-Trunk, Trunk-Sweep and Horizontal-Trunk are conspicuous movements and typically cause other elephants to take notice and adopt similar behavior and appear to be done to draw the attention of others.J-Trunk occurs in all age/sex groups except young calves and infants.References:Poole & Granli 2021.

"AmbivalentBehaviors engaged in when an individual has simultaneous tendencies to perform two incompatible activities, such as fight or flight.",Rumble (0),"A highly variable class or type of tonal vocalisations that is characterised by calls with very low fundamental frequencies. Rumbles are the most frequently heard call type in the repertoire of all age/sex classes of African savannah elephants and are easily distinguished from other types by their very low frequencies and clear harmonic structure. Fundamental frequencies range from 8-34 Hz depending upon the callers age, body size, arousal level and call context.Some rumbles are highly modulated, powerful sounds; others rise or fall in pitch; some rumble contours are flat, some undulating, and still others are jittery. Rumbles range in duration from less than half a second to almost 12 seconds and may be emitted as a soft fluttering whisper or an explosive throaty resonance with sound pressure levels up to 103 dB extrapolated to 5 m from source.References:Douglas-Hamilton 1972: ch 6 [Growl]; Berg 1983 [Growl]; Payne et al 1986; Leong et al 2003; Poole et al 1988; Stoeger-Horwath et al 2007; Poole 2011.
